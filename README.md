# Plagiarism Checker 

Overview
--------
This repository contains two related plagiarism-checker projects and demo tooling:

- A Flask-based API and Streamlit front-end under `plagiarism_app/` that demonstrate a plagiarism-checking API, Rate limiters, and Kong configuration for API gateway demos.
- A standalone Streamlit-based checker and small training pipeline under `plagiarism_checker/` used to build a toy logistic regression model and to test similarity/highlighting locally.
